Excellent and very deep question — and one that gets right to the heart of **real-time data architecture for betting platforms** like Bet365, 1xBet, or Betway. What you’re describing — *instant navigation, smooth updates, no flicker, and almost no loading lag* — is the result of a **sophisticated combination of caching, real-time streaming, and intelligent state management**.  

Let’s break it down clearly 👇  

---

## 🧩 1. They Don’t Use Traditional REST APIs for Live Data  
Professional betting sites **don’t rely solely on REST APIs** for live and pre-match data. REST is too slow and inefficient for rapidly changing odds and fixtures.  

Instead, they use:
- **WebSockets** (for continuous data streaming)  
- or **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**  
- or even **custom persistent TCP connections**

With WebSockets, the server pushes updated odds, scores, and market changes **in real-time** to the client.  
So instead of “fetch → wait → render → flicker,” the data is **already connected** and **streaming smoothly**.

---

## ⚙️ 2. They Maintain an In-Memory Data Layer (Client + Server)
Professional sites maintain a **real-time in-memory data store** both on the backend *and* the frontend.

- **Backend (Server-side)**: They use Redis, but not as a cache per page. It acts as a **high-speed pub/sub memory layer**.  
  - Data from external feeds (e.g., THE ODDS API, SUPABASE DATABASE for our manual matches etc) enters the Redis layer.  
  - Updates are broadcast via **Redis Pub/Sub** or **Streams** to connected app servers or clients via WebSockets.  

- **Frontend (Client-side)**:  
  - Data is stored in **a global state (like Zustand, Redux, or React Query cache)**.  
  - Instead of refetching data when switching between pages, components **subscribe to existing cached data** that’s kept in memory as long as the app is open.  

So navigation feels instant — you’re not “refetching,” you’re “re-rendering from cache.”

---

## 🔄 3. Data Diffing & Patch Updates (Instead of Full Reloads)
This is *key*. Sites like Bet365 **never replace the whole match list or odds table**.  
They only **patch small changes** — for example:  
- If one market’s odds change, only that cell updates.  
- If a match ends, that one disappears without re-rendering everything.

They achieve this by:
- Keeping **a normalized data structure** (matches, markets, odds as separate entities).  
- Listening for **diff payloads** from their data feed.  
- Using **virtual DOM or fine-grained reactivity (like Solid.js, React Fiber, or custom renderers)** to update only what changed.

Result: *No flicker, no reload, just smooth updates.*

---

## 🗂️ 4. Smart Preloading & Background Syncing
When you open Bet365’s homepage:
- It silently **preloads upcoming pages’ data** (live, line, and top leagues).  
- The moment you click “Live,” it already has the data locally — maybe just refreshing deltas (updates).

You can replicate this by:
- Using **background fetchers** (e.g., `React Query` with `staleTime` and `prefetchQuery`).  
- Fetching next-page data silently when the user hovers or scrolls near navigation.  

---

## 🧠 5. State Hydration and Reuse Between Pages
They don’t destroy and recreate state when navigating pages.  
The site uses a **single-page app (SPA)** architecture — the “pages” are just routed components that reuse the same global data layer.  

For example:
- `liveMatches`, `prematchMatches`, and `marketData` are all global states.
- When navigating, the UI **shows what’s already in state** instantly while background updates arrive.

That’s why even the loader animation is just aesthetic — data is already available.

---

## 🧮 6. Distributed Feed Aggregation & Message Brokers
On the backend, the betting company receives constant event streams from multiple providers.  
They use **Kafka / RabbitMQ / NATS Streaming** for:
- Broadcasting updates to all active user sessions  
- Aggregating different feed sources (for odds, stats, scores)

This is why their odds updates are synchronized globally within milliseconds.

## 🚀 7. Techniques You Can Use to Achieve Similar Smoothness

Here’s how you can implement a lightweight version:

### Frontend:
- Use **React Query** or **Zustand** for global, persistent cache.  
- Establish a **WebSocket connection** for real-time updates (not periodic REST fetching).  
- Use **incremental rendering** — only update parts that change, not the whole component tree.  
- Implement **data prefetching** when app loads.  
- Keep **same state store across routes** (don’t clear state on page navigation).

### Backend:
- Use **Redis Streams or Pub/Sub** to broadcast data changes to connected clients.  
- Use a **WebSocket gateway (like Socket.IO, FastAPI WebSocket, or NestJS Gateway)**.  
- Cache and broadcast updates instantly — not by refetching from the API on demand.  
- Keep a **live data service** that runs continuously, feeding your Redis cache.

---

## ✅ Example Flow You Should Aim for:

1. When your app starts:
   - Connect to your backend WebSocket stream.
   - Preload essential data (popular leagues, upcoming matches).

2. When user navigates between pages:
   - Instantly render from in-memory cache.
   - Update only small parts via streaming deltas.

3. On backend:
   - Continuously receive and push real-time updates from SportMonks API.
   - Store and broadcast them via Redis Pub/Sub to connected clients.

4. On frontend:
   - Subscribed components update instantly without full re-render.
