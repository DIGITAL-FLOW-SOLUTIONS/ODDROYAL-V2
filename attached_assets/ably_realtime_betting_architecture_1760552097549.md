# Move to a managed realtime push gateway (Ably) for The Odds API integration

Short answer: **Move to a managed realtime push gateway (Ably) + keep Redis as the canonical in-memory store and a small aggregator worker**.  
This gives you the behavior you want — always-on aggregated state, tiny delta messages, silent updates, instant navigation — while removing operational headaches like connection scaling, backpressure, retries, and fanout.

---

## Why this will solve your problems
- Managed push gateways handle **persistent connections**, reconnections, backpressure, and message delivery guarantees automatically.
- Your server will **aggregate + diff** data from **The Odds API**, write a canonical state into Redis, and **publish tiny deltas** (around 4KB or less) to an Ably channel.
- Clients **subscribe to channels**, maintain local normalized state, apply **patches** instead of full replacements, display cached data instantly, and only update changed fields → no flicker.
- Navigation feels instant since the client reuses in-memory store (Zustand/React Query) populated from Redis snapshot on connect.

---

## Recommended stack (minimal headaches)
- **Push gateway:** Ably (chosen)
- **Server / worker:** Node.js (Express-based worker)
- **Cache / State:** Redis (in-memory canonical store + pub/sub)
- **Frontend:** React (with Zustand or React Query) + memoized components + React 18's `startTransition`
- **Message format:** JSON delta patches
- **Monitoring:** Sentry + Grafana/Prometheus + Ably dashboard + server logs

The Odds API → Aggregator Worker → Redis (canonical state) → Ably Channels → Clients (React app)
```

## Step-by-step migration + implementation checklist

### 1) Server: aggregator worker (poll + diff + publish)
Create `worker/aggregator.js` (Node.js). Responsibilities:
- Poll The Odds API for the sports and leagues you care about.
- Compute a minimal diff vs the previous snapshot stored in Redis.
- Write new canonical snapshot to Redis.
- Publish the diff to Ably channel `sports:football` (or per-league: `league:2145`).

Example snippet:
```js
import Ably from 'ably';
import Redis from 'ioredis';
import axios from 'axios';

const ably = new Ably.Rest({ key: process.env.ABLY_API_KEY });
const redis = new Redis(process.env.REDIS_URL);

async function pollLeague(league) {
  const res = await axios.get('https://api.the-odds-api.com/v4/sports', {
    params: { apiKey: process.env.ODDS_API_KEY }
  });

  const data = res.data;
  for (const match of data) {
    const key = `fixture:${match.id}`;
    const prev = JSON.parse(await redis.get(key) || 'null');
    const diff = computeDiff(prev, match);
    if (diff && Object.keys(diff).length) {
      await redis.set(key, JSON.stringify(match));
      await ably.channels.get('sports:football').publish('update', diff);
    }
  }
}
```

### 2) Redis data model (canonical)
- `fixture:<id>` → stringified JSON (current canonical match object)
- `league:<id>:fixtures` → sorted set of fixture ids (score by start time)

### 3) Backend publishing policy & throttling
- **Server-side throttle** updates to 200–500ms windows.
- **Priority events** (like goals or odds spikes) should publish immediately.
- **Batch odds changes** to reduce noise.

### 4) Channel design
- Use per-league or per-region channels for scale.
- Message format:
```json
{
  "type": "patch",
  "fixture_id": "13347740",
  "changes": [
    { "path": "markets.h2h.home_odds", "value": 2.15 },
    { "path": "status", "value": "in_play" }
  ],
  "ts": 1699999999999
}
```

### 5) Frontend subscription & local state merging
- Client connects to Ably with a short-lived token from your backend.
- On connect: fetch snapshot from backend `/api/hydrate` (reads Redis) for initial render.
- Then subscribe to Ably for live deltas.
- Queue and flush updates every 200–500ms; merge changes into Zustand/React Query store.

Example snippet:
```ts
import Ably from 'ably/promises';
import create from 'zustand';

const useStore = create(set => ({ fixtures: {}, applyPatch: patches => set(state => {/* merge */}) }));

export function useConnectAbly(token) {
  const queueRef = useRef([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    const client = new Ably.Realtime({ token });
    const channel = client.channels.get('sports:football');
    channel.subscribe('update', msg => queueRef.current.push(msg.data));

    const t = setInterval(() => {
      const batch = queueRef.current.splice(0);
      if (batch.length) {
        startTransition(() => useStore.getState().applyPatch(batch));
      }
    }, 250);

    return () => { clearInterval(t); client.close(); };
  }, [token]);
}
```

### 6) Hydration endpoint
Implement `/api/hydrate?league=<id>`:
- Read league fixture ids from Redis.
- Return the current snapshot of all visible fixtures.
- Used by the frontend on first page load.

### 7) Rendering best practices
- Normalize data (fixtures, markets, outcomes).
- `React.memo` for match components.
- Use CSS transitions for subtle odds updates.
- Use `react-window` for virtualization on large lists.
- Never replace the full state — merge only changed keys.

### 8) Logging & monitoring
Add logs for:
- Aggregator diff rate, published message sizes, and latency.
- Redis IO latency.
- Ably publish success/failure.
- Frontend render counts and FPS stability.

### 9) Rollout plan
1. Deploy aggregator worker to Replit.
2. Start publishing diffs to `sports:football`.
3. Implement `/api/hydrate` and Ably token auth on Express backend.
4. Update frontend to hydrate from Redis snapshot and subscribe to Ably.
5. Test for stable, flicker-free live updates.

---

## Key engineering details
- Use short-lived Ably client tokens for security.
- Coalesce updates server-side before publishing.
- Single-writer model for fixtures to avoid race conditions.
- Goal and major event updates published immediately.
- Clients rehydrate on reconnect using `/api/hydrate?since=<last_ts>`.

## Example ready-to-run setup
**Aggregator (Node.js + Ably + Redis):**
```js
import Ably from 'ably';
import Redis from 'ioredis';
import axios from 'axios';

const ably = new Ably.Rest({ key: process.env.ABLY_API_KEY });
const redis = new Redis(process.env.REDIS_URL);

async function computeAndPublish(fixture) {
  const key = `fixture:${fixture.id}`;
  const prevRaw = await redis.get(key);
  const prev = prevRaw ? JSON.parse(prevRaw) : null;
  const changes = computeDiff(prev, fixture);
  if (!changes.length) return;
  await redis.set(key, JSON.stringify(fixture));
  const msg = { fixture_id: fixture.id, changes, ts: Date.now() };
  await ably.channels.get('sports:football').publish('update', msg);
}

async function pollAndProcess() {
  const res = await axios.get('https://api.the-odds-api.com/v4/sports', {
    params: { apiKey: process.env.ODDS_API_KEY }
  });
  for (const f of res.data) {
    await computeAndPublish(f);
  }
}

setInterval(pollAndProcess, 5000);
```

**Frontend subscription (React):**
```ts
import Ably from 'ably/promises';
import create from 'zustand';

const useStore = create(set => ({ fixtures: {}, applyPatch: patches => set(state => {/* merge */}) }));

export function useConnectAbly(token) {
  const queueRef = useRef([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    const client = new Ably.Realtime({ token });
    const channel = client.channels.get('sports:football');
    channel.subscribe('update', msg => queueRef.current.push(msg.data));

    const t = setInterval(() => {
      const batch = queueRef.current.splice(0);
      if (batch.length) {
        startTransition(() => useStore.getState().applyPatch(batch));
      }
    }, 250);

    return () => { clearInterval(t); client.close(); };
  }, [token]);
}
```

---

## Monitoring checklist
- Message size < 8 KB
- Render rate < 2 per second per match
- Stable 54–60 FPS
- Redis latency < 5ms
- Ably publish latency < 200ms

---

## Final action plan
1. Deploy aggregator worker using the code above.
2. Implement `/api/hydrate` to serve Redis snapshots.
3. Connect Ably in frontend using token auth.
4. Merge updates locally with throttled rendering.
5. Validate smooth updates and no flicker.

This approach is already proven in production by real sportsbooks and will give you the consistent, smooth, no-flicker experience you want.
