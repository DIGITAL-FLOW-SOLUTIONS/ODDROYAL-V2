I want to implement the match details page (like PlayWin: https://playwin.top/line/201/375/13213260) that loads when a user clicks on a match (either from the line page or the live page).

ðŸ”¹ Important Notes

Do not modify the Top Navigation Bar, Left Sidebar, or Betslip when building this pages â€” use what the project already implemented.

Focus on implementing the Center Main Section (markets & odds) and the Right Match Info Card (win probability + past meetings) that will be placed on top of the betslip as per the screenshot.

Design and functionality should closely match PlayWinâ€™s layout and interaction as shown in this reference screenshot uploaded here. Link: https://playwin.top/line/201/375/13213260
.

âœ… Center Main Section (Markets & Odds)

When a user clicks a match:

Fetch all available markets for that match using the SportMonks API:

odds/bookmakers/markets endpoint.

Include markets like: 1X2, Double Chance, Totals, Handicap, Both Teams to Score, Correct Score, Half/Full Time, Result + BTTS, Player Props (if available) designed as in the screenshot.

Structure them into categories:

Main Markets (always expanded): Winner (1X2), Double Chance, Totals (Over/Under), Handicap.

Additional Markets (collapsible dropdowns):

Goals (in halves, both teams, last goal, time of goal, etc.)

Correct Score

Team Specials (Win to Nil, Clean Sheet, Individual Totals, Penalty)

Combination Markets (Result + BTTS, Double Chance + BTTS)

Player Specials (Anytime scorer, first scorer, etc. if SportMonks provides).

For each market:

Display outcomes in a table-like grid, odds in decimal format.

Odds update live (SportMonks provides odds updates via fixtures & bookmakers endpoints).

âœ… Right Match Info Card

Win Probability

Calculate from odds implied probability: probability = 1 / odds.

Normalize so Brentford + Draw + Chelsea = 100%.

Display as horizontal bars with percentage values.

Previous Meetings

Use SportMonks head-to-head endpoint: fixtures/head2head/{team1Id}/{team2Id}.

Show last 5 meetings with results summary (W/D/L for each team).

Other Match Details

Show match timer (live clock if in-play).

Venue, date, kickoff time (from fixtures endpoint).

âœ… Functionality Details

Odds should auto-refresh every 15â€“30 seconds using SportMonks live data updates.

Markets should be collapsible (accordion style).

Odds format must remain decimal (SportMonks default).

When a user clicks an odd, it should add the selection to the existing Betslip logic (do not rebuild Betslip, just connect odds selection events to it).

âœ… Technical Guidance

API Calls:

GET /fixtures/{fixture_id}?include=odds,localTeam,visitorTeam,stats,head2head

GET /odds/fixtures/{fixture_id}

Use the fixture_id from the match clicked in Line/Live pages to fetch market details.

Store responses in state (React/Next.js: useState + useEffect) or equivalent framework logic.

Design: replicate the PlayWin odds table UI â€” blue collapsible headers, neatly aligned odds, grid layout.

ðŸ‘‰ Final Goal:
When a user clicks a match, they should be taken to a dedicated page with:

Center: detailed odds markets (structured, expandable).

Right: match info card (probabilities + H2H stats).

Odds should be clickable and go to Betslip.

The layout and functionality should mirror PlayWinâ€™s reference page, but powered by SportMonks API data.
