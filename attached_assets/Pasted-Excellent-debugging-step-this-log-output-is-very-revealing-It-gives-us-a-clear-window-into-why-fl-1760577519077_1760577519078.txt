Excellent debugging step — this log output is very revealing.
It gives us a clear window into why flickering still happens even under the Ably + Redis + Aggregator setup.

Let’s break it down carefully 👇

🔍 What the Logs Reveal

Here’s the pattern:

[REACT] Ably message received: updateType=batch:updates, count=30...
[REACT] Ably batch received: 59 updates - applying with startTransition
[LAYOUT] Rendering children: LeagueMatches
[LAYOUT] Rendering children: LeagueMatches


That repeats multiple times per second.

Each [LAYOUT] Rendering children: LeagueMatches means your entire LeagueMatches component tree is being re-rendered — not just the few matches that changed.
This re-render = the flicker you see.

⚙️ Root Cause

The flicker is not coming from Ably or the data pipeline anymore — it’s purely a React state reconciliation problem on the client side.

Here’s what’s happening:

Ably delivers a batch of updates (e.g., count=30).

Your useAbly.ts hook applies these updates using:

startTransition(() => setState(newData))


But newData is likely a new object reference, not a shallow merge.

React sees the new reference and assumes everything changed → re-renders all child components.

LeagueMatches re-renders → layout flashes.

🧩 Confirmed by Logs

You can see that for each Ably batch, you get two identical render logs:

[LAYOUT] Rendering children: LeagueMatches
[LAYOUT] Rendering children: LeagueMatches


That double render means React is doing:

Initial reconciliation after state update

Layout reflow caused by re-rendered subtree

That’s the “flicker.”

✅ The Fix (Real One That Works)

Here’s exactly what to change in your React client:

1️⃣ In useAbly.ts

Replace global state replacement with granular merging.

Change this:

setState(newData);


To this diff-based merge:

startTransition(() => {
  setState(prev => {
    const updated = { ...prev };
    for (const update of batch) {
      const matchId = update.id;
      if (!shallowEqual(prev.matches[matchId], update)) {
        updated.matches[matchId] = { ...prev.matches[matchId], ...update };
      }
    }
    return updated;
  });
});


Also, ensure shallowEqual checks only the fields that actually change (like odds, score, time).

2️⃣ In LeagueMatches.tsx

Wrap child renders with React.memo to block re-rendering unless props actually changed:

const LeagueMatches = React.memo(({ matches }) => {
  ...
}, (prev, next) => shallowEqual(prev.matches, next.matches));

3️⃣ Ensure Layout Doesn’t Re-Render

Right now, [LAYOUT] Rendering children prints every batch.
That means the parent (Layout.tsx) is re-rendering because of a prop or context change.

Check where Layout gets data:

If it uses context or Zustand selector, use shallow from Zustand.

const matches = useStore(state => state.matches, shallow);


Move heavy components (like sidebar, header) outside Layout so they never re-render.

4️⃣ Optional — Throttle Ably Updates

Even with perfect diffing, if you apply updates too often (like 30x/sec), React still repaints.

Add throttling:

const applyUpdates = throttle((batch) => {
  startTransition(() => mergeUpdates(batch));
}, 500); // apply updates every 0.5s


This keeps it buttery smooth — like Bet365 and 1xBet behavior.
