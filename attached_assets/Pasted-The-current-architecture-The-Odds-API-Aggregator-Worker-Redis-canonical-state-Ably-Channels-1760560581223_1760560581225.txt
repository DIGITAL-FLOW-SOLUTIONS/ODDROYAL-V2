The current architecture (The Odds API → Aggregator Worker → Redis (canonical state) → Ably Channels → React Client) is working well, but I still notice occasional flickering on the frontend when live data updates come in.
Please thoroughly investigate and eliminate any causes of flickering. Follow these exact debugging and optimization steps:

1. Identify the Render Source

Add console logs or React DevTools Profiler to detect which components re-render when new Ably updates arrive.

Specifically check:

MatchRow / MatchCard components

The container list (MatchesList or similar)

The MarketSection or OddsGrid components

Log for each:

console.count(`Render: MatchRow ${fixture.id}`);


If the entire list re-renders on every Ably update, isolate why — only the updated fixture(s) should re-render.

2. Inspect State Merge Logic

Check the function that merges incoming Ably data into Zustand/React Query/Redux store.

Confirm it does not replace the entire fixtures object each time.

It should merge by key:

set(state => ({
  fixtures: {
    ...state.fixtures,
    [update.fixture_id]: {
      ...state.fixtures[update.fixture_id],
      ...update
    }
  }
}));


Replacing fixtures entirely triggers full re-render → flicker.

3. Add Equality Checks

Wrap all UI components rendering fixture data with React.memo and a custom equality check:

export const MatchRow = React.memo(({ fixture }) => {
  // render odds, score, etc.
}, (prev, next) => JSON.stringify(prev) === JSON.stringify(next));


Or better: use shallow equality for only the relevant props (odds, score, minute).

4. Throttle or Batch UI Updates

Review your Ably subscription handler.

Confirm updates are throttled or batched (e.g. apply every 200–500ms).

If updates are processed too frequently, the UI re-renders too often, creating perceived flicker even if diffing is correct.

Example:

const queueRef = useRef([]);
useEffect(() => {
  channel.subscribe('update', msg => queueRef.current.push(msg.data));
  const t = setInterval(() => {
    if (queueRef.current.length > 0) {
      const batch = queueRef.current.splice(0);
      startTransition(() => useStore.getState().applyPatch(batch));
    }
  }, 300);
  return () => clearInterval(t);
}, []);

5. Check CSS Transitions

Inspect whether odds or score elements have CSS transitions or animations that conflict with state updates.

Example issue: opacity: 0 → 1 animations can cause flicker if triggered by re-renders.

Ensure your animation classes only trigger on value changes, not every re-render.

6. Verify Stable Keys in Lists

In React lists, ensure each item has a stable key:

{fixtures.map(f => <MatchRow key={f.id} fixture={f} />)}


If key changes between updates (e.g., using array index), React will unmount/remount DOM nodes → visible flicker.

7. Profile FPS and Paint Events

Add a performance.mark() and console.time() around render batches.

Confirm that FPS stays stable when updates flow.

If FPS drops below ~50 frequently, throttle update frequency or investigate excessive React reconciliations.

8. Final Optimization Pass

Once root cause found, fix accordingly:

If caused by full state replacement → switch to per-fixture merge.

If caused by unstable keys → fix key props.

If caused by frequent updates → increase batching interval.

If caused by layout shifts → fix CSS/DOM structure.

Add small visual smoothing: use CSS fade-in/out or number rolling transitions for odds to make updates imperceptible.

✅ Goal

After the fix:

Only changed fixtures re-render.

No global list repainting.

No layout shifts or blinking.

FPS stays 55–60 during heavy update flow.
