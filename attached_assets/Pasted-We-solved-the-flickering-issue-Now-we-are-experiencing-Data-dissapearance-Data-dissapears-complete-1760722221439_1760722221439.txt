We solved the flickering issue. Now we are experiencing Data dissapearance. Data dissapears completely from the site and they is nothing displayed in all the pages. I tried to gather console logs of different pages when navigated to and reloaded. Maybe they can help us know where is the reason making data to dissapear:

Let me make some clarifications so you get exactly whats happening:

When the app starts the data is always there, so i didn't count exactly after how long before it disappears but it can be few minutes, a lot of minutes or even hours, but one thing is a time comes when it disappears, and when it does it can return after few minutes or more minutes and even sometimes it takes hours. 
The deal is to make the data not to disappear at all. 

To help you further i have uploaded 2 screenshots of the console log right when it disappeared on screenshot error1 and the other screenshot error2 is a continuation of the first screenshot.

Let me clarify something again, you said: It is not that the site ‚Äúloses everything until the next refresh repopulates Redis." On that i noted down the "until the next refresh repopulates Redis", and i want to say during the time when data is available we have updates, because as you know our architecture that we use, it does make pools from THE ODDS API thats why data is available for that while. The problem is why is there a period that data is not available - Thats what we want to stop.
