**Prompt for Replit: Updating Admin Panel Matches & Markets Page**

Replit, please update the **Admin Panel** at route `/prime-admin` to implement the following detailed features for the **Matches & Markets** page:

---

### 1. Matches Table (Full Sports Coverage)

* Create a **dynamic Matches Table** that lists matches for **all sports provided by the SportMonks API**.
* The table should:

  * Group matches by **Sport** (Football, Basketball, Tennis, etc.).
  * Within each sport, group matches by **League**.
  * Under each league, display all **matches (fixtures)**.
  * Clearly indicate **Live matches** (highlight in red or add a LIVE badge) vs **Pre-match fixtures**.
  * Columns should include:

    * Sport Name
    * League Name
    * Home Team vs Away Team
    * Kickoff Time
    * Odds Summary (main odds like 1X2)
    * Status (Live, Pre-match, Finished)
    * Admin Actions (Edit | Override | Delete)

---

### 2. Create Match Button & Form

* Add a **"Create Match" button** above the Matches Table.
* On click, open a **form modal or drawer** with the following fields:

#### Form Fields:

1. **Sport Type** (dropdown: Football, Basketball, Tennis, etc.).
2. **League Name** (text input or select existing leagues).
3. **Home Team** (text input).
4. **Away Team** (text input).
5. **Kickoff Time** (datetime picker).
6. **Odds Setup**:

   * Admin can enter odds manually for markets such as:

     * 1X2 (Home, Draw, Away)
     * Over/Under Goals
     * Both Teams To Score
     * Handicap Odds
   * Allow multiple odds markets to be configured.
7. **Result Simulation**:

   * Admin can pre-set the **match outcome**.
   * Options to add **goal events**: which team scored, and at what time (minute).
   * This enables **simulation of the match** once kickoff time arrives, behaving like a live match.

#### Behavior:

* Once created, the manual match should:

  * Appear in the Matches Table alongside API-fetched matches.
  * Be available for users to bet on, with the same odds and markets as API matches.
  * Transition from Pre-match → Live → Finished automatically based on the **Kickoff Time and simulated events**.

---

### 3. Admin Match Actions

* For both API and manually created matches, provide **Admin Actions**:

  * **Edit Match** → Update odds, kickoff time, markets, or results.
  * **Override Result** → Manually settle the match and update bets.
  * **Delete Match** → Remove match completely.

---

### 4. Security & Data Handling

* Ensure all create/update/delete actions are **authenticated** and **logged** in the admin audit trail.
* Matches created manually should be tagged as `manual_match = true` in the database.
* Make sure results updates trigger bet settlement workflows.

---

### 5. UI/UX Requirements

* Matches Table must be **scrollable, paginated, and searchable**.
* Use **badges and highlights** for Live/Pre-match.
* Keep consistent styling with the rest of the Admin Panel (sidebar, header, theme).
* Form should have **validation** (e.g., kickoff time cannot be in the past, odds must be valid numbers).

---

✅ With these updates, the Admin Panel will:

* Allow admins to view all API matches grouped by sport/league.
* Allow creation of manual matches across any sport.
* Support full odds and market setup.
* Support result simulation to behave like real matches.
* Integrate seamlessly into the betting flow for users.
