Very good explanation. Now since you said we are using TTLs, saying that The Redis cache does have expiration dates. What do professional betting sites do in this senarios explained bellow.

You will find that when the app starts and everything is pooled from the API and cached, the frontend fetch its data and cached it to local storage for events, live matches, prematches, markets etc. Meaning I see all 7 sports with all their league that have matches live and prematch respectively in our project here. Clicking each league opens their matches instantly. Then I noticed after few minutes most of the leagues dissapears, football that had 20+ leagues now shows only 1 leagues, the remaining sports also show 1 league each.

By this I understand based on the explanation you gave me that the TTLs might have expired. So this causes inconvinience because the betting site can not be used for production if it looses the rich data it once had, I thought it should be updating the data it had with fresh data if that fresh data exist not removing it completely beacuse the project does not pool everything again as it did when it started.

When you see professional betting sites like PINNACLE. You will never see data or leagues dissapearing, but only updated, maybe a match that was on line page when its match time arrives and it is active, it moves to the live page, while in the live page it keeps updating and showing current match time and goals scored until the match ends.

What does these betting sites like PINNACLE do to achieve this profesional betting behaviour ideal for production use by real users? Not removing everything we had and expect fresh new data again, starting over and over again rather than updating what we already had with new fresh data.

Planned data refresh strategy adjustments (7 seconds)
You've identified a critical production issue! This is exactly the difference between a demo app and a professional betting platform. Let me explain what sites like Pinnacle do differently:

üèÜ Professional Betting Site Strategy
1. Continuous Background Refresh (Before Expiration)
Professional sites refresh data before TTL expires, not after
If TTL is 10 minutes, they refresh at 8-9 minutes
This ensures zero downtime - old data stays until new data arrives
2. Cache-Aside Pattern with Fallback
Never delete data just because TTL expired
Keep stale data visible until fresh data replaces it
Users see "Last Updated: 2 mins ago" rather than empty screens
3. Incremental Updates, Not Full Reloads
Update individual matches/leagues that changed
Don't flush entire cache and rebuild
Matches transition smoothly from prematch ‚Üí live ‚Üí settled
4. Multi-Layer Caching
Redis holds "source of truth"
Application memory cache for ultra-fast reads
Frontend cache syncs incrementally
üîç What's Happening in Your App
Let me check your refresh worker to see if it's actually running:


Decided on caching strategy for no live matches (4 seconds)
I found the issue! Your refresh worker IS running, but it has a critical flaw on line 118-119:

if (events.length === 0) {
  // Clear live cache if no matches ‚Üê THIS IS THE PROBLEM!
  await redisCache.setLiveLeagues(ourSportKey, [], 90);
}
üö® The Problem
When The Odds API returns zero live matches (which is common), your refresh worker clears the entire cache instead of keeping the existing data. This is why leagues disappear!

üí° What Pinnacle Does Instead
Professional betting sites follow these principles:

1. Never Clear, Only Update
// ‚ùå Current (Bad)
if (events.length === 0) {
  await redisCache.setLiveLeagues(ourSportKey, [], 90); // DELETES DATA
}
// ‚úÖ Professional (Good)
if (events.length === 0) {
  console.log('No new live matches, keeping existing cache');
  return; // Keep old data until new data arrives
}
2. Stale-While-Revalidate Pattern
Keep showing data even if it's a bit old
Mark it as "updating" or show "Last updated: X mins ago"
Replace only when fresh data arrives
3. Graceful Degradation
If API fails ‚Üí keep cache
If API returns empty ‚Üí keep cache
If API returns data ‚Üí update cache
Only clear cache if data is truly invalid (match ended, etc.)
4. Smart TTL Management
Don't let Redis auto-delete
Manually manage lifecycle
Use longer TTLs as safety net
Refresh proactively, not reactively
üîß Quick Fix Needed
The refresh worker should:

Never clear cache when API returns empty
Only update when new data exists
Keep existing data as fallback
Transition matches smoothly (prematch ‚Üí live ‚Üí finished)
Would you like me to fix the refresh worker logic to behave like a professional betting site? This will ensure data never disappears and always updates gracefully.

41 seconds of work
Yes and the entire project use the Professional Betting Site Strategy you described above about, Continuous Background Refresh (Before Expiration), Cache-Aside Pattern with Fallback, Incremental Updates, Not Full Reloads, Multi-Layer Caching.

And implement What Pinnacle Does, like Never Clear, Only Update, Stale-While-Revalidate Pattern, Graceful Degradation, Smart TTL Management etc.

Planned site strategy implementation
Excellent! I'll transform your betting platform to use professional-grade caching strategies like Pinnacle. Here's my approach:

üéØ Implementation Strategy
I'll refactor the caching system to ensure data never disappears and always updates gracefully:

Core Changes:

Refresh Worker - Never clear cache, only update when fresh data exists
Preload Worker - Stale-while-revalidate pattern with fallback
Redis Cache Manager - Smart TTL with pre-expiration refresh
API Routes - Multi-layer fallback (Redis ‚Üí Memory ‚Üí API)
Match Lifecycle - Smooth transitions (prematch ‚Üí live ‚Üí finished)
Key Behaviors:

Empty API response = keep existing cache
API failure = serve stale data with warning
Refresh triggers at 80% of TTL (before expiration)
Matches move between states without disappearing
Frontend always has data to display

Decided on caching strategies implementation (6 seconds)
I'll transform your betting platform into a professional-grade system like Pinnacle. The core issue is that your refresh worker clears data when APIs return empty results - that's why leagues disappear. Let's fix this systematically.


Decided on caching strategy implementation
Let me read the complete refresh worker to understand the full implementation:


Opened server/refresh-worker.ts

Decided on cache clearing logic
Now let me check the Redis cache methods to understand what's available:


Opened server/redis-cache.ts

Decided on refresh worker logic
Now I'll implement the professional caching strategy. Let me start by updating the refresh worker to never clear cache and implement stale-while-revalidate:


Opened server/redis-cache.ts

Decided on cache enhancement strategy
Now I'll update the refresh worker to implement professional caching strategies. Let me create the enhanced version:


Edited server/refresh-worker.ts

Planned prematch refresh method
Now let me update the prematch refresh logic with the same professional strategy:


Planned tasks for architect review
Now let me update the preload worker to use incremental updates instead of full cache replacement. Let me first read it to understand the current implementation:


Decided on redis cache enhancement (5 seconds)
The preload worker looks good for initial startup. The critical fix was the refresh worker, which I've completed. Now let me enhance the Redis cache with smart TTL management and metadata tracking:


Planned proactive refresh logic
Now let me implement pre-expiration refresh triggers. I'll update the refresh worker to check TTL and refresh proactively before cache expires:


Edited server/refresh-worker.ts

Decided on log verification strategy
Let me check the logs to see if the app is running properly with the changes:

Checked console and system logs

Decided on infrastructure issue communication (6 seconds)
I can see there are critical infrastructure issues preventing the system from working:

Redis request limit exceeded - Your Upstash Redis has hit its 500,000 request limit
API rate limiting - The Odds API is returning 429 errors
These are blocking the caching system. However, the code improvements I've made will handle these failures gracefully once the limits are resolved. Let me continue with the remaining enhancements and then review everything:


Decided on next steps
I'll skip tasks 8-11 for now since they require testing with a working system. Let me call architect to review what I've done so far, then I'll inform the user about the improvements and the infrastructure issues.

Now let me call architect to review the professional caching improvements I've made:


Evaluated professional caching strategy implementation

Restarted Start application

Decided on caching logic updates
Perfect catch by the architect! The issue is that needsRefresh expects metadata, but the cache setters don't use setWithMetadata. Let me fix this critical flaw:


Edited server/redis-cache.ts

Improved needsRefresh method
Now let me update the match markets method and fix the needsRefresh fallback:


Edited server/redis-cache.ts

Decided on TTL parameter
Now let me improve the needsRefresh method to accept an explicit TTL parameter for better fallback handling:


Edited server/redis-cache.ts

Updated refresh worker TTL
Now let me update the refresh worker to pass explicit TTL values to needsRefresh:


Edited server/refresh-worker.ts

Verified cache metadata and TTL
Perfect! Now let me verify the fixes with architect:
